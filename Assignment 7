Prove: If n = 25, 100, or 169, then n is a perfect square and is the sum of two perfect squares.
Indicate which method of proof you used.

Prove: The sum of two odd integers is even.
Hint: By definition, even integers can be expressed as 2n, thus odd integers can be expressed as 2n + 1
(2 * 7) + 1 = 15
2 * 7 = 14
7 + 7 = 14
Prove: The sum of an even integer and it's square is even 
2 + 2 = 4
4^2 = 4
4 * 4 = 16
Prove by Contradiction: If n squared is odd, then n is odd
n^2 is odd, n is odd
n = n * n
2^2 = 4
2 * 2 = 4
