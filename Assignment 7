Prove: If n = 25, 100, or 169, then n is a perfect square and is the sum of two perfect squares.
Indicate which method of proof you used.

Prove: The sum of two odd integers is even.
Hint: By definition, even integers can be expressed as 2n, thus odd integers can be expressed as 2n + 1
n + n = even

Prove: The sum of an even integer and it's square is even 

Prove by Contradiction: If n squared is odd, then n is odd
n^2 is odd
n is odd
(2j + 1)(2j + 1)
4j^2 + 2j + 1
2(2j^2 + 2j) + 1
